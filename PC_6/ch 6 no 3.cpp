/*
Winning Division
Write a program that determines which of a company’s four divisions (Northeast,
Southeast, Northwest, and Southwest) had the greatest sales for a quarter. It should
include the following two functions, which are called by main.
   • double getSales() is passed the name of a division. It asks the user for a
     division’s quarterly sales figure, validates the input, then returns it. It should
     be called once for each division.
   • void findHighest() is passed the four sales totals. It determines which is the
     largest and prints the name of the high grossing division, along with its sales
     figure.
     
     Input Validation: Do not accept dollar amounts less than $0.00.
