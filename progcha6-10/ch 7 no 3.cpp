/*
Chips and Salsa
Write a program that lets a maker of chips and salsa keep track of their sales for five
different types of salsa they produce: mild, medium, sweet, hot, and zesty. It should use
two parallel five-element arrays: an array of strings that holds the five salsa names and
an array of integers that holds the number of jars sold during the past month for each
salsa type. The salsa names should be stored using an initialization list at the time the
name array is created. The program should prompt the user to enter the number of jars
sold for each type. Once this sales data has been entered, the program should produce
a report that displays sales for each salsa type, total sales, and the names of the highest
selling and lowest selling products.
Input Validation: Do not accept negative values for number of jars sold.
